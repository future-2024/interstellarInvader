- 2D gameplay
- Basic concept is that we want to have multiple spaceships from the 4 different planets we
have created for our NFTS ( Hydra, Centaurus, Andromeda, Dorado)
Numbers are up to discussion but potentially 5 spaceships from each planet.
- These spaceships to be shooting the different objects in front (like in the pictures above)
- For example when all the aliens are shot down, the user progresses one level forward, if the
user then gets past 5/10 levels he gets rewarded in our token. (this is where we would
probably want to create the game on a different chain as there is no smart contracts on
stellar so we cannot code these rewards). Open to any suggestions about the best way to go
forward with this.
- We’d have specific token payouts for everytime the user progresses through the levels, but
these payouts to be locked until a minimum withdrawal amount is met
- The user is then incentivised to buy different spaceships, to progress through the levels
faster and earn more rewards
- We want some element to make the levels progressively harder too but don’t have a plan on
how to do that yet
- Simple game controls of just moving up, down, left, right and shoot- Unlockable features, we want an option for the user to be able to claim different spaceships
once he passes certain levels too so he is incentivised to carry out playing the game
- Simple HUD menu layout;
Play
Link to buy token (ISX)
Leader board
Challenge someone else maybe?
In the future we are also releasing a big ecosystem of NFTS so we would like to integrate these into
the gamer too at some point so we could have an NFT marketplace within the game and once an
NFT is purchased it can be used in the game to play


GAMEPLAY LOOP- 

Level 1 Gameplay
The aliens are the weakest in this level so when 1 alien warship is hit 5 times by the player spaceship it disappears. Each level to contain 24 alien warship which appear 8 at a time.
At any point there is only 8 warships you're shooting, once these are shot down, more alien warships appear from the top of the screen. The level continues until all the spaceships are shot down.
The warships should be quite slow to hit and they should be firing missiles at the player spaceship quite slowly too so it gives the player a chance to understand the game, also to show the level progression, so Level 1 will be easiest then followed by level 2 etc etc.
In this level, all the warships should stay and shoot from one diagonal line with no opportunity to move, this will be changed as the levels progress.
